# youtube_video_downloader
Ah if you need to download some youtube video you can use this script. I've used pytube and tkinter to make it.

You just need to enter the url, select the path to store the video, and after selecting the quality you prefer hit the download button to start downloading it.
All the videos will be in .mp4 format @30fps regardless of quality. If your file is downloaded successfully it will show the message.

You need to install the pytube to run this script - 'pip install pytube'.


Soon maybe I will learn Django and make a website to host this script :-)
